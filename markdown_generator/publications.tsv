2017-06-06	Badminton Video Analysis based on Spatiotemporal and Stroke Features	Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval	Most of the broadcasted sports events nowadays present game statistics to the viewers which can be used to design the gameplay strategy, improve player's performance, or improve accessing the point of interest of a sport game. However, few studies have been proposed for broadcasted badminton videos. In this paper, we integrate several visual analysis techniques to detect the court, detect players, classify strokes, and classify the player's strategy. Based on visual analysis, we can get some insights about the common strategy of a certain player. We evaluate performance of stroke classification, strategy classification, and show game statistics based on classification results.	 W. T. Chu and S.

2020-12-28	Android Malware Classification Based on Permission Categories Using Extreme Gradient Boosting	Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Sustainable Information Engineering and Technology	Mobile malware has become the centerpiece of most security and privacy threats on the Internet. Especially with the openness of the Android market, many malicious apps are hiding in a large number of applications, which makes malware detection more challenging. In this study, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is used to establish the Android-based malware detection and classification framework. The framework utilizes APK permission categories extracted from Android applications. The comparison of modeling results demonstrates that the XGBoost is especially suitable for Android malware classification and can achieve 74.40% of F1-score with real-world Android application sets.
