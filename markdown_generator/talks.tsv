Movie Summarization Based on Indonesian Subtitles with Restricted Boltzmann Machine	Conference proceedings talk	talk-1	International Conference on Sustainable Information Engineering and Technology (SIET) 2019	2019-09-28	Aruna Senggigi Resort & Convention, Senggigi, Kabupaten Lombok Barat, West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia	A summary of a movie provides a concise description of the movie both concretely and abstractly. Automatic movie summarization can be applied to get a movie summary. In this study, we propose a movie summarization method on Indonesian subtitles with 5 stages, namely: preprocessing, feature extraction, feature enhancement, sentence ranking, and summary generation. The preprocessing consist of document segmentation, paragraph segmentation, case folding, normalization, stopword removal, and part-of-speech tagging. Twelve intrinsic features, namely: number of thematic words, sentence position, sentence length, sentence position relative to paragraph, number of proper noun, number of numerals, number of verbs, number of noun, term frequency-inverse sentence frequency, sentence to centroid similarity, bi-gram key phrase list, and tri-gram key phrase list extracted and enhanced with Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to improve the quality of the summary. Results indicate that the summary produced is neutral or has the meaning of the name of the main character mentioned in the summary, sentence one with the next sentence relates and does not tell the core of the movie. Compare to movie summarization without RBM, with RBM improves the average quality of the summary of 1% (Precision), 10% (Recall), and 8% (F1-score). Questionnaire results also show that the movie summarization developed in this study produces a summary that is suitable for the provided subtitles.
