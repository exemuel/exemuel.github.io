06/06/2017	Badminton Video Analysis based on Spatiotemporal and Stroke Features	Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval	Most of the broadcasted sports events nowadays present game statistics to the viewers which can be used to design the gameplay strategy, improve player's performance, or improve accessing the point of interest of a sport game. However, few studies have been proposed for broadcasted badminton videos. In this paper, we integrate several visual analysis techniques to detect the court, detect players, classify strokes, and classify the player's strategy. Based on visual analysis, we can get some insights about the common strategy of a certain player. We evaluate performance of stroke classification, strategy classification, and show game statistics based on classification results.	W. T. Chu and S.

28/09/2019	Movie Summarization based on Indonesian Subtitles with Restricted Boltzmann Machine	Proceedings of 2019 4th International Conference on Sustainable Information Engineering and Technology, SIET 2019	A summary of a movie provides a concise description of the movie both concretely and abstractly. Automatic movie summarization can be applied to get a movie summary. In this study, we propose a movie summarization method on Indonesian subtitles with five stages, namely: preprocessing, feature extraction, feature enhancement, sentence ranking, and summary generation. The preprocessing consist of document segmentation, paragraph segmentation, case folding, normalization, stopword removal, and part-of-speech tagging. Twelve intrinsic features, namely: number of thematic words, sentence position, sentence length, sentence position relative to paragraph, number of proper noun, number of numerals, number of verbs, number of noun, term frequency-inverse sentence frequency, sentence to centroid similarity, bi-gram key phrase list, and tri-gram key phrase list are extracted and enhanced with Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to improve the quality of the summary. Results indicate that the summary produced is understandable and has the name of the main character in the provided text. Compare to movie summarization without RBM, RBM improves the average quality of the summary of 6% (F1-score). Questionnaire results also show that the movie summarization developed in this study produces a summary that is suitable for the provided subtitles.	S. I. G. Situmeang, R. K. Lubis, F. J. N.

28/12/2020	Android Malware Classification Based on Permission Categories Using Extreme Gradient Boosting	Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Sustainable Information Engineering and Technology	Mobile malware has become the centerpiece of most security and privacy threats on the Internet. Especially with the openness of the Android market, many malicious apps are hiding in a large number of applications, which makes malware detection more challenging. In this study, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is used to establish the Android-based malware detection and classification framework. The framework utilizes APK permission categories extracted from Android applications. The comparison of modeling results demonstrates that the XGBoost is especially suitable for Android malware classification and can achieve 74.40% of F1-score with real-world Android application sets.
