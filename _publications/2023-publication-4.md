title: "A Cluster and Association Analysis Visualization using Moodle Activity Log Data"

permalink: /publication/28/12/2023-publication-1
excerpt: 'The course activity log is where a learning management system (LMS) like Moodle keeps track of the various learning activities. In order to conduct a quicker and more in-depth examination of the students' behaviors, the instructor may either directly examine the log or make use of more complex methodologies such as data mining. The majority of the proposed methods for analyzing this log data center mostly on predictive analysis. In this research, cluster analysis and association analysis, two separate data mining functions, are investigated in order to analyze the log. The students' activities are used in the cluster analysis performed with K-Means++, and the association analysis performed with Apriori is used to investigate the connections between the students' various activities. A dashboard presentation of the findings is provided in order to facilitate clearer comprehension. Based on the findings of the analysis, it can be concluded that the structure of the student cluster is medium, whereas the association between the activities undertaken by students is positively correlated and well-balanced. The subjective review of the dashboard reveals that the visualization is already sufficient, but there are some recommendations for making it even better.'

The course activity log is where a learning management system (LMS) like Moodle keeps track of the various learning activities. In order to conduct a quicker and more in-depth examination of the students' behaviors, the instructor may either directly examine the log or make use of more complex methodologies such as data mining. The majority of the proposed methods for analyzing this log data center mostly on predictive analysis. In this research, cluster analysis and association analysis, two separate data mining functions, are investigated in order to analyze the log. The students' activities are used in the cluster analysis performed with K-Means++, and the association analysis performed with Apriori is used to investigate the connections between the students' various activities. A dashboard presentation of the findings is provided in order to facilitate clearer comprehension. Based on the findings of the analysis, it can be concluded that the structure of the student cluster is medium, whereas the association between the activities undertaken by students is positively correlated and well-balanced. The subjective review of the dashboard reveals that the visualization is already sufficient, but there are some recommendations for making it even better.
